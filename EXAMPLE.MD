# Example implementation in Python

## 1] Architecture (Assumes the following)

- Homebridge server is : `192.168.1.22`
- Raspberry Pi with the Python script controlling the blinds : `192.168.1.55`
- You have your MAC address and key for each blind you wish to control by [following these instructions](https://github.com/dnschneid/pysmartblinds/blob/master/README.md#discovering-mac-and-keys-for-blinds).

## 2] Python installation

````bash
sudo apt install -y python3-pip
pip3 install pygatt
pip3 install pexpect
````
Finally, copy the two python files in this projects python folder, httpserver.py and pysmartblinds.py, to your raspberry pi's home folder.
You must either run the program from the command line by typing:
`python3 httpserver.py` 
or setting up a systemd process to run it automatically as per the directions below.

## 3] Python Script configuration

Replace the BLINDS section of httpserver.py with your blind information. This requires finding the key. Whatever you name each blind is what needs to go in the config.json urls. The description can be whatever you want. AGAIN, [the MAC address and key you must follow these instructions to get for your own blinds](https://github.com/dnschneid/pysmartblinds/blob/master/README.md#discovering-mac-and-keys-for-blinds). Specifically each blind key is different, and is broken out in the script, so if your key is 112233445566aa for a blind, in the python script it is broken into groups of two like below.

```
BLINDS = {
'living_room_middle': {
        'description': 'Living Room Middle',
        'mac': 'AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF',
        'key': (0x11, 0x22, 0x33, 0x44, 0x55, 0x66, 0xaa)
    },
        'living_room_right': {
        'description': 'Living Room Right',
        'mac': 'AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF',
        'key': (0x11, 0x22, 0x33, 0x44, 0x55, 0x66, 0xaa)
    },
        'living_room_left': {
        'description': 'Living Room Left',
        'mac': 'AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF',
        'key': (0x11, 0x22, 0x33, 0x44, 0x55, 0x66, 0xaa)
    },
}
```
## 2] Homebridge plugin installation

The installation instructions differ depending on how you installed homebridge. Until a more elegant program is written using noble or some other program that directly connects homebridge with the blinds, this solution requires a python script to both interface with the blinds (one at a time) and an httpserver for the urls to call in the homebridge plugin. This is super ugly and hacked together, but for now it works.

Usually this will install it:
````bash
sudo npm install -g homebridge-mysmartblinds
````

## 3] Homebridge accessory configuration

Here is a homebridge `config.json` with the minimal valid configuration. The bridge information is already there unless you have not set up homebridge yet. You must add an accessory for each blind, and create a name for each blind, and change the ip address to wherever you are running the python script, this assumes you are running it on the same device as your homebridge. Also change the "living_room" to whatever you named the blind in httpserver.py: (example with 3, 1 for each blind):

````json
{
    "bridge": {
        "name": "DemoMinimalisticHttpBlinds",
        "username": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
        "port": 51826,
        "pin": "123-45-678"
    },
  
    "description": "DEV NODEJS MACBOOK",
  
"accessories": [
    {
        "name": "Living Room Middle",
        "accessory": "mysmartblinds",

    "get_current_position_url": "http://192.168.1.55:1500/living_room_middle/pos",
    "set_target_position_url": "http://192.168.1.55:1500/living_room_middle/set/%position%",
    "get_current_state_url": "http://192.168.1.55:1500/living_room_middle/pos"
    },
    {
        "accessory": "mysmartblinds",
        "name": "Living Room Right",
  
            "get_current_position_url": "http://192.168.1.55:1500/living_room_right/pos",
            "set_target_position_url": "http://192.168.1.55:1500/living_room_right/set/%position%",
            "get_current_state_url": "http://192.168.1.55:1500/living_room_right/pos"
            },
        {
            "accessory": "mysmartblinds",
        "name": "Living Room Left",
  
            "get_current_position_url": "http://192.168.1.55:1500/living_room_left/pos",
            "set_target_position_url": "http://192.168.1.55:1500/living_room_left/set/%position%",
            "get_current_state_url": "http://192.168.1.55:1500/living_room_left/pos"
}

], 
    "platforms": []
}
````

Beware, these three parameters are not checked!  
(`get_current_position_url`, `set_target_position_url`, `get_current_state_url`)  
If you forgot to write them in your accessory, the module will crash.

Also, in the `set_target_position_url` parameter, the placeholder `%position%` will be replaced by the value selected in the iPhone's Home App. 

#### 3] Configuration to run the httpserver.py at startup using systemd (just like the instructions for having homebridge running using systemd)

Enter the following command:
`sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/pysmartblinds.service`

Add the following text:
```
[Unit]
Description=My Script Service
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/
User=pi
Type=idle
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/httpserver.py
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
exit by hitting ctrl-x and hitting y to save.
Then continue with the following commands to start it up:
```
sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/pysmartblinds.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable pysmartblinds.service
sudo systemctl start pysmartblinds.service
```
And if you want to check the status:

`sudo systemctl status pysmartblinds.service`

The httpserver.py should now be running.

# That's all
